## Introduction

Teapotio forum provides a full feature forum solution for small to large communities.

If you'd like to download the standalone version of the forum, please refer [to the README file located in the teapotio-forum-standard repository](https://github.com/teapotio/teapotio-forum-standard/blob/master/README.md).

## Integrate to your app

### composer.json

Add the following to your composer file:
```json
{
    "require": {
        "teapotio/teapotio-forum": "dev-master",
    }
}
```

Run the following command: ` $ composer update `

### config.yml

Add the following to your config.yml file:
```yml
imports:
    - { resource: @TeapotioSiteBundle/Resources/config/config.yml }
    - { resource: @TeapotioSiteBundle/Resources/config/security.yml }
```

You can omit the security.yml if you'd like to make your own.

If you'd like to start with some default settings:
```yml
imports:
    - { resource: @TeapotioSiteBundle/Resources/config/config_default.yml }
```

Add the different bundles to your Doctrine config:

```yml
doctrine:
    orm:
        entity_managers:
            default: # the name of the entity manager might be different here
                mappings:
                    TeapotioForumBundle: ~
                    TeapotioSiteBundle: ~
                    TeapotioUserBundle: ~
                    TeapotioImageBundle: ~
                    TeapotioUserBundle: ~
```

### routing.yml

You can include the routes by including the main Teapotio routing file:

```yml
TeapotioForum:
    resource: "@TeapotioSiteBundle/Resources/config/routing.yml"
    prefix:   /
```

Otherwise, you can manually each route prefix from the file above in your own.

### AppKernel.php

Extends your AppKernel class with Teapotio's AppKernel class:
```php
use Teapotio\Components\AppKernel as TeapotioAppKernel;

class AppKernel extends TeapotioAppKernel
{
    $bundles = array(
        ...
    );

    $bundles = array_merge($bundles, parent::registerBundles());

    ...
}
```

Otherwise you can register the different bundle manually based the bundles registered in Teapotio's AppKernel class.
